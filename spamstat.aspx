     <br /> <p class="col-10" style="color:black ;  font-size:large" > 
         There are two definitions for SPAM:

 

A tinned meat product made mainly from ham.
Irrelevant or unsolicited messages sent over the Internet, typically to a large number of users, for the purposes of advertising, phishing, spreading malware, etc.
 

Both these definitions are accurate. But why did I cover them both? Well, just as a fun fact. Internet SPAM actually gets its name from the canned meat brand called SPAM. SPAM cans we’re very popular and would often take up large spaces in stores. You could find them everywhere in very large quantities.

 

When internet mass messaging started to arise, the name SPAM was mentioned somewhere on a forum. It stuck with it and the phenomenon eventually got more popular than the canned food itself. Today, ask someone if they know what SPAM is and they will probably refer to it as unsolicited messages over the internet.

    So why do people use SPAM as a marketing method? Well… in short, because it works. It’s becoming harder to do it because of filters and advanced technology, but it still works. Cold selling is still very effective. If you’ve watched Wolf of the Wall Street then you know how this works.

 

The difference was that Jordan Belford was cold calling people he knew were interested in stocks. A spammer often doesn’t care about that. They just collect a huge number of e-mails and then blast them with any offer they have. Not once, but continuously.

 

In SEO, SPAM is usually a byproduct of BlackHat SEO. In order to promote their offers, spammers use techniques like keyword stuffing and article spinning (automatic rewriting of content, using software) as well as automatic link building. You should never engage in such techniques, as it could harm your business and even bring legal issues.

 

However, this article isn’t about what you shouldn’t be doing, but about how to protect yourself when others try to do shady things. Although spam and scam have many things in common, we’re not going to cover the ‘business’ types behind SPAM, but the methods used to do it.

 

These being said, here are 5 of the most common methods spammers use and how you can effectively protect yourself against them.

            Before you go, let’s recap some of the most important things that you should do and shouldn’t do in order to protect yourself from SPAM:
 <ul style="font-size:large"><li> Always use Captcha</li> &nbsp
<li> Keep software up to date</li> &nbsp

     <li> Don’t subscribe to e-mail lists with primary e-mail</li> &nbsp
     <li> Monitor your backlinks </li> &nbsp
     <li>If your website’s software gets old, it also gets vulnerable. A client has recently spotted weird articles on her website that she did not post, as well as a multitude of comments rolling in </li> &nbsp
     <li>  In order to prevent your website from a negative SEO attack, you have to constantly monitor your backlinks activity</li> &nbsp
      <li>  Use defacement monitoring and detection tools</li> &nbsp

      <li>If your website is crawlable and indexed by Google, make sure you have some sort of Captcha installed on your forms, login pages and comment sections.</li> &nbsp

<li> Don't post personal data, like your birthday, vacation plans, or your address or phone number, publicly on social media</li> &nbsp
      </ul>  </p>
