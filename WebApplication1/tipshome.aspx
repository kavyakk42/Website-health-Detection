    <div class="col-4"> <br /><p style="font-size:22px ;font-family:'Californian FB'; margin-right:-60px" > The risk of cyber crimes is increasing in today’s modern world. According to IT Management and Consulting in Phoenix, Arizona, they reported that one in three Americans got hacked within the past year, and hackers attack someone every 39 seconds.

<br />How do you even begin protecting yourself where cyber attacks on steadily on the rise? These researched security tips can help protect you from the vicious predators:</p> </div>

<div class="col2"></div>
<br />

<h2 style="font-family:'Californian FB'; font-size:40px;font-weight:bold" > &nbsp  &nbsp 1.Monitor your credit card statements</h2>
<div class="row"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp <div class="col-6"><img src="tips/credit.jpeg"  style="width:600px" /> </div>
    <div class="col-4"> <br /><p style="font-size:22px ;font-family:'Californian FB'" > 
        According to the Pew Research Center, 64% of Americans have endured a significant data breach, and large shares of the public lack trust in federal and government institutions and social media sites to guard their personal information.

<br />Being sure you are not hacked is essential. Monitor your bank and credit card statements. Even small amounts deducted can indicate something is not right. It could mean that attacker is stealing small fractions of money from millions of accounts.

                              </p> </div>
</div> 
<div class="col-2"></div> <br />


<h2 style="font-family:'Californian FB'; font-size:40px;font-weight:bold" > &nbsp  &nbsp 2. Use a difficult password or phrase combinations for each login</h2>
<div class="row"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp <div class="col-6"><img src="tips/5c6fc5d19b8465db8cf5ee94_maxresdefault.jpg"  style="width:600px" /> </div>
    <div class="col-4"> <br /><p style="font-size:20px ;font-family:'Californian FB'" > 
       Use ID and password combinations that are difficult to guess for each account. Do not write them down somewhere. Create passwords or phrases that contain letters, numbers, and special characters, and change them frequently. Phrases are also great to use and difficult to discover. For Wifi, use Wifi. They would never guess it.

<br />Remembering too many passwords may be complicated if you have multiple logins. You can also create a personal format for the passwords. For example, use yourname(twodigits)@websitename.

                              </p> </div>
</div> 
<div class="col-2"></div> <br />

<h2 style="font-family:'Californian FB'; font-size:40px;font-weight:bold" > &nbsp  &nbsp 3. Avoid pop-ups at all costs</h2>
<div class="row"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp <div class="col-6"><img src="tips/Remove-pop-ups.jpg"  style="width:600px" /> </div>
    <div class="col-4"> <br /><p style="font-size:22px ;font-family:'Californian FB'" > 
        According to Internet World Stats, numerous studies surveyed Internet users and discovered that nearly 80% of them had a “very negative” opinion of pop-ups.

<br />Pop-ups are known to be a challenge for cyber safety because they have malicious software that deceives a user into verifying information. By downloading a software setup file, which cannot have a 1.2 MB size, always check for the file name and source. Pop-ups that offer site surveys on e-commerce sites store malicious codes most of the time.

                              </p> </div>
</div> 
<div class="col-2"></div> <br />



<h2 style="font-family:'Californian FB'; font-size:40px;font-weight:bold" > &nbsp &nbsp 4.Physically secure your laptop by activating a firewall</h2>
<div class="row"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp <div class="col-6"><img src="tips/4.jpeg"  style="width:600px" /> </div>
    <div class="col-4"> <br /><p style="font-size:22px ;font-family:'Californian FB'" > 
      A firewall monitors all incoming and outgoing traffic. If your antivirus does not have a firewall, enable the Windows firewall.

<br />Install and frequently update licensed anti-virus software on your computer to protect it. Microsoft performed research that showed how almost 10% of Windows 8 users are using expired AV software on their computers, and that makes them four times more vulnerable to cyber attacks. Most antivirus software protects computers from malware, rootkits, and viruses. Therefore, there will be no need to install more than one.


                              </p> </div>
</div> 
<div class="col-2"></div> <br />



<h2 style="font-family:'Californian FB'; font-size:40px;font-weight:bold" > &nbsp  &nbsp 5. Do not share codes by two-step verification</h2>
<div class="row"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp <div class="col-6"><img src="tips/2 step.jpeg"  style="width:600px" /> </div>
    <div class="col-4"> <br /><p style="font-size:22px ;font-family:'Californian FB'" > 

Enable two-step verification. When you enter your password, the website will also request for you to enter a verification code sent by text to your phone if you log in by a different device. Although hacking into your phone can be difficult, a hacker may attempt to find out the code by using social engineering. Therefore, that code should never get forwarded to anyone.
                              </p> </div>
</div> 
<div class="col-2"></div> <br />


<h2 style="font-family:'Californian FB'; font-size:40px;font-weight:bold" > &nbsp  &nbsp 6. Do not upload personal data unencrypted or to online file sharing</h2>
<div class="row"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp <div class="col-6"><img src="tips/6.png"  style="width:600px" /> </div>
    <div class="col-4"> <br /><p style="font-size:22px ;font-family:'Californian FB'" > 
        It takes less than five minutes to encrypt a zip file or any file with AES-256 bit encryption. On the other hand, it is worth it. It saves your personal information from getting hacked. Even when large businesses confront a cyber attack, you can be safe by using Windows and BitLocker to encrypt hard disk drives with your personal information. AES Crypt is known to be the best.
                              </p> </div>
</div> 
<div class="col-2"></div> <br />

<h2 style="font-family:'Californian FB'; font-size:40px;font-weight:bold" > &nbsp  &nbsp 7. Do not trust emails</h2>
<div class="row"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp <div class="col-6"><img src="tips/email.png"  style="width:600px" /> </div>
    <div class="col-4"> <br /><p style="font-size:22px ;font-family:'Californian FB'" > 
Never trust emails that offer rewards or money, especially if you did not subscribe. Never share any personal information unless necessary, you know why they requested it, and the other party can be trusted.                      

                              </p> </div>

<h2 style="font-family:'Californian FB'; font-size:40px;font-weight:bold" > &nbsp  &nbsp 8. Monitor your security settings on social media</h2>
<div class="row"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp <div class="col-6"><img src="tips/8.jpeg"  style="width:600px" /> </div>
    <div class="col-4"> <br /><p style="font-size:22px ;font-family:'Californian FB'" > 
If you notice a bizarre post from one of your buddies online, never click on it. Always report it to the site as malicious and let your buddy know. Perform an update when it is time. Yes, the slow process can be a pain, but security updates are essential. Windows, Mac, and Linux become updated with the latest security and are not limited to additional security features. It also searches for security weaknesses in your system. Keep them up to date because hackers always attempt to discover vulnerabilities. Predators like to feel in control by targeting weaknesses.

<h2 style="font-family:'Californian FB'; font-size:40px;font-weight:bold" > &nbsp  &nbsp 9. Never save personal information on websites</h2>
<div class="row"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp <div class="col-6"><img src="images/thumb-1920-361383.jpg"  style="width:600px" /> </div>
    <div class="col-4"> <br /><p style="font-size:22px ;font-family:'Californian FB'" > 
          Many sites request you to save your personal information. Saving your information makes your transactions process quicker. Never do that because your personal information can become stolen if that site’s database is on untrustworthy websites. Search for the last six or eight digits of your credit card numbers on Google with double quotes around them to ensure your personal information is not available online.                   
        </p> </div>
</div> 
<div class="col-2"></div> <br />

<h2 style="font-family:'Californian FB'; font-size:40px;font-weight:bold" > &nbsp  &nbsp 10. Do not trust WiFi</h2>
<div class="row"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp <div class="col-6"><img src="tips/10.jpeg"  style="width:600px" /> </div>
    <div class="col-4"> <br /><p style="font-size:22px ;font-family:'Californian FB'" > 
    Never trust WiFi. Encrypt it with a secure password or WPA2 encryption. Never use public WiFi to make transactions because it is fragile. If you have personal or secret information on your laptop, it is vulnerable. Never use financial or corporate transactions. Monitor and secure the default settings and passwords.      
        </p> </div>
</div> 
<div class="col-2"></div> <br />

     <h2 style="font-family:'Californian FB'; font-size:40px;font-weight:bold" > &nbsp  &nbsp 11. Use encryption online always</h2>
<div class="row"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp <div class="col-6"><img src="images/prevent-malware.jpg"  style="width:600px" /> </div>
    <div class="col-4"> <br /><p style="font-size:22px ;font-family:'Californian FB'" > 
Stay on guard when sharing personal information online. Never share your name, phone number, address, or finances online unless you know the other party can be trusted. Be sure that the websites are safe and use https as their address. For example, their website address should appear as https://facebook.com. Https is essential for sites that include financial transactions. Https indicates that the data you send and receive is encrypted. Enable your privacy settings when you are using social media sites as well.

 <h2 style="font-family:'Californian FB'; font-size:40px;font-weight:bold" > &nbsp  &nbsp 12. Always encrypt your data</h2>
<div class="row"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp <div class="col-6"><img src="images/shutterstock_749866270-900x506.jpg"  style="width:600px" /> </div>
    <div class="col-4"> <br /><p style="font-size:22px ;font-family:'Californian FB'" > 
       It is essential to always encrypt your data, especially for the most sensitive files such as financial records or tax returns. Additionally, create regular back-ups of all your primary data to save it into another place. Never leave your credit card around the house for your kids to use it. </p> </div>
</div> 
<div class="col-2"></div> <br />


<h2 style="font-family:'Californian FB'; font-size:40px;font-weight:bold" > &nbsp  &nbsp 13. Keep your cellular devices safe in every way possible</h2>
<div class="row"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp <div class="col-6"><img src="tips/13.jpeg"  style="width:600px" /> </div>
    <div class="col-4"> <br /><p style="font-size:22px ;font-family:'Californian FB'" > 
       Mobile devices are prone to hackers and viruses. Keep the security settings high. Although you may download apps from the Google Play store, your phone camera can still become hacked, and the thieves can steal the pictures they took from your phone.
